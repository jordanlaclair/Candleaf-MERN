## General

My first "big" project I've made using the MERN stack. Candleaf is a prototype store that delivers eco-sustainable, carefully handmade candles. This first started as a practice project so that I can learn MongoDB but quickly escalated. This is by no means the perfect MERN project as this was purely a for-fun project where I got to use so many new technologies for the first time and there still may exist bugs, however this is my proudest project yet as I've learned so much from it throughout the journey. I transferred from JavaScript to Typescript in the middle of the project as I realized it would help immensely to avoid type errors and my inspiration was from Figma for the designing aspect of the project.

## Technologies

- React ⚛️
- MongoDB 🍃
- Mongoose 🍃
- Express 🚄
- NodeJS
- Typescript (type checking)
- Netlify (hosting + free SSL)
- Heroku (backend)
- Styled Components 💅
- React Router DOM (routes, rerouting, authentication)
- Auth-0 (authentication)
- Redux (state management)
- Redux Persist (persisted state to local storage)
- React-country-region-selector (for user country/region form selection)
- React-Lottie
- Material UI

## Conclusion

By the end of the project I realized that GraphQL probably would've been a way better option instead of a RESTful API since I was retrieving a lot of unnecessary data in the backend that was ultimately unused. With GraphQL this would negate this unnecessary requested data by only retrieving the data that is needed. This is something that I will keep in mind for the future and I'm excited to learn. As well, the backend has so much more data that could have been utilized such as filtering the candles by tags, sorting by most popular (using its purchase count), sorting by most reviews, price range, wax, burning time, weight, etc. I have the knowledge to do this, however school just started and I want to put all my focus towards that. This is why I decided to deploy this project early.
